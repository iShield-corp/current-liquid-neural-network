Based on the project knowledge, I can see several potential improvements for your hybrid liquid-spiking neural network system:
Architecture Enhancements
1. Advanced Liquid Backbone Variants

Consider implementing Neural Circuit Policies (NCP) variants beyond the current CFC/LTC/NCP options, such as sparse NCP architectures with structured pruning
Experiment with hierarchical liquid layers where different layers operate at different time constants for multi-scale temporal processing

2. Spike Encoding Improvements

Implement population coding where multiple spiking neurons encode the same value with different thresholds, improving robustness
Add burst coding mechanisms to capture rapid temporal changes more efficiently
Consider rate-temporal hybrid coding combining firing rates with precise spike timing

3. Attention Mechanism Refinements

Extend beyond basic attention to sparse attention patterns (local, strided, or learned sparsity) to reduce computational overhead
Implement temporal attention that specifically leverages the spike timing information
Add cross-modal attention between the liquid and spiking pathways for better information fusion

Training & Optimization
4. Advanced Learning Strategies

Implement meta-learning approaches to quickly adapt the liquid time constants to new tasks
Add curriculum learning that progressively increases sequence length and task complexity
Use knowledge distillation from larger transformer models to bootstrap the system

5. Gradient Flow Improvements

Explore alternative surrogate gradient functions beyond the current implementation (e.g., multi-Gaussian, exponential decay)
Implement gradient checkpointing more strategically to balance memory and computation
Add noise injection during training for better generalization in the spike domain

Efficiency & Deployment
6. Neuromorphic Hardware Optimization

Further optimize for specific neuromorphic chips (Intel Loihi 2, IBM TrueNorth, BrainScaleS-2)
Implement adaptive spike step reduction that uses fewer time steps when possible
Add dynamic time constant adjustment during inference

7. Quantization & Compression

Apply mixed-precision quantization specifically tailored to liquid and spiking components
Implement structured pruning that respects the biological connectivity constraints
Use low-rank decomposition for the attention weight matrices

Feature Additions
8. Multi-Modal Fusion
Your roadmap mentions this - I'd suggest implementing early fusion with separate liquid-spike encoders per modality, then a shared fusion layer with cross-attention
9. Online Learning Capabilities

Add plasticity rules (e.g., STDP variants) for continual learning without catastrophic forgetting
Implement meta-plasticity where the system learns how to learn from experience

10. Interpretability Tools

Develop spike raster visualization showing how information flows through time
Create liquid state space analysis tools to understand what temporal patterns are captured
Add attention heat maps specific to the spike-timing domain

Specific Technical Recommendations
Based on your current architecture:

Increase num_spike_steps dynamically based on input complexity (currently fixed at sequence_length//4)
Experiment with heterogeneous spike thresholds across layers instead of uniform threshold=1.0
Add residual connections specifically between liquid layers to help with very deep networks
Implement layer-wise learning rate adaptation as liquid and spiking components may benefit from different learning dynamics

Would you like me to dive deeper into any of these improvements, or would you prefer specific implementation guidance for particular enhancements?
